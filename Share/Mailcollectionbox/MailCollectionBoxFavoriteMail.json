I should note that there is a 1.32% possibility that Babylonia might look into relevant liabilities on the matter.

Depending on the investigation process, you may abstain from submitting the damage report.\\n...On an unrelated note, according to Nanami's testimony and the relevant files in Babylonia's database, I have learned that today is, according to the archaic cultural customs from an Eastern country with a long history and vibrant culture, what the people of that culture call \"Lunar New Year\".\\nIn the past year, we went through countless battles and choices together.

You said the beginning of memory was worth commemorating, but then you immediately stopped and apologized... Bambinata can't help but wonder if that has brought you any trouble.\\nYou said that you didn't want Bambinata to feel uncomfortable about your language... but Bambinata won't feel uncomfortable about the memory loss as long as Mistress and you are around. B-but... Bambinata could forget your birthday without the memory data. Bambinata doesn't want to miss your birthday...

        "Content": "An Exclusive Interview About the \"Prismatic Trace\" Exhibition | Ayla: Exploring All Colors in Each Other's Eyes (Abstract)\\n\\nDecember 15th, Babylonia News \u2014 \"Prismatic Trace\" made a stunning debut in section C-06 of the latest modern art exhibition. Created by Ayla, one of Babylonia's most renowned rising artists, this exhibition features captivating, diverse visual elements that present the experiences and encounters of different individuals in the Reconquista Age. It has been extremely well received, with the number of viewers reaching an all-time high over all the past exhibitions.\\nOur reporter learned that all the works displayed in \"Prismatic Trace\" were completed by a joint effort between the WGAA and Task Force. Miss Ayla also agreed to an exclusive interview to share her ideas and experiences during the creation of this exhibition.\\n\\nQ: Can you share with us the reason for choosing this theme?\\n\\n\"Art seems to have become a lot less significant in this era, which actually drives artists to think further... To me, this blue planet itself makes the vastest and most brilliant canvas. It has different colors in everyone's eyes: some see it as cheerfully bright, while others think it's gloomy and dim... That makes me want to portray the worlds in different people's eyes in various forms, because everyone can interpret 'reality' in distinct ways.\"\\n\\nQ: We feel that every piece of work displayed is highly impressive. There is even a \"recreate\" device next to each of them that allows the viewers to understand how they were created. Why did you choose this format?\\n\\n\"It came from my recent experience during a battle on the surface. As for the recreate device... I want to give special thanks to a person who helped me a lot during the creation of this exhibition. That person is my muse and has always supported me whenever I feel confused and lost despite not realizing it... They have always been fighting for humanity's future, and I'd like to record their battle stories and portray the world in their eyes because their presence always brings us immense spiritual strength.\"\\n\\nQ: We have noticed that you named the empty canvas at the end of the exhibition \"Masterpiece\". Some say the name comes from the belief that your \"most satisfied work\" is always the next incomplete one. What do you think about that?\\n\\n\"Haha... I like that interpretation! Personally, I take pride in every work that I put my heart into! Hmm... Actually, I just had an idea of what I should draw on that one, and I can't wait to make it happen!\"\\n\\nQ: (Laughs) Is that what you call \"Eureka\"? Could you give us a little hint about your new work then? Not just me, I believe your fans are all curious about the true look of this \"masterpiece\" in your heart.\\n\\n\"Well, at least for now, it's still a girl's secret! Besides... It does take a lot of courage...\"",

On that day, you can take a good look at it with me as your personal guide! I also have a surprise for you and can't wait to hear your comment in person!\\nMy works can never fully capture all the battles you have fought so far. Still, thanks to you and everyone else's effort, I am able to follow your trails to pick up all these forgotten stars and connect them together to make them known to more people.\\nHehe... Did I sound too serious? Perhaps I haven't switched back from the exhibition mode. Anyway, I still have one last Activation Day wish, which is to draw the best portrait ever. Will you be my model and help me fulfill this wish?\\nI know you would ask why would I keep drawing you after having done so many of your portraits already? Hmm... Maybe this is the only moment I can have you staring at me?\\nHaha, just joking! Even for me, saying that feels a little too embarrassing...\\nAnyway, just come over when you are free, alright?

Yet now, with you and Gray Raven by my side, I have found a sense of belonging and warmth. My attachments to these newfound elements have honed my blade, becoming both my cherished treasure and the very motivation behind my fight.\\n\\nThe first day of the new year symbolizes a fresh start, and quite coincidentally, I noticed that you didn't schedule any work for today.

To tell you the truth, everyone in Gray Raven noticed how you secretly put up those paper-cut crafts in the lounge yesterday. We all pretended not to see, wanting to preserve the little surprise our \"Commandant\" had made an effort to arrange. I disabled the double-ended encryption on the electronic locks in my private lounge before I went to sleep last night, so it should have saved you some time cracking it.\\n\\nNow that I've discovered this surprise, you have my gratitude, and I thank you on behalf of Murray... I genuinely want you to know that your presence has been the best surprise, not just for me but for all of us in Gray Raven. In the coming year, all I wish for is your well-being and safety as you lead us forward. As for these kinds of \"little surprises,\" I suggest picking a time that aligns better with your biological clock to do them rather than staying up until the early morning hours.\\n\\nBy the way, I heard that thanks to a particular member of the Engineering Force, Logistics issued a new regulation that strictly limits the number of explosives that can be assigned to each squad. So, congratulations, you don't have to worry about being summoned and questioned on the first morning of the new year. However, if you still want to experiment with those dangerous explosives... I got my hands on a few for display purposes that wouldn't attract the attention of the military court, given that I can't really stop those occasional wild thoughts of yours and that both Liv and Lucia love those fireworks.\\n\\nAnyway, it has been yet another year filled with numerous endeavors for Gray Raven, and without a doubt, we will persist in moving forward as a team in the year ahead.\\n\\nCommandant, Happy New Year.",

So, perhaps you can consider this my first \"selfish wish\" in the new year. Please accept this lucky coin, and may it rid you of all hardships and help you achieve your desires. If any adversity occurs, I believe the united strength of Gray Raven will prevail.

Here's your health check-up report from last month.\\nLiv was supposed to bring it back to you, but it seems she might have been delayed by something. After she finished writing her notes this morning, she left the report at the medical center. I tried calling her, but she didn't answer... I assume she is already with you by now.\\nShe always meticulously checks your health reports multiple times, fearing that something might be overlooked. Then, she creates detailed plans, with categorized notes for different aspects. You should know best what kind of person she is. She never shows any signs of anxiety in front of me and always keeps things to herself...\\nEven on a day like today, her thoughts are not focused on herself. She must have prepared something for you and the other two members of Gray Raven. Well... that's just Liv for you.\\nSo, please take good care of yourself. This is not medical advice from me as a doctor but a wish from Liv's heart.\\nOther than that, be sure to take her heart's desire and make it come true.",

And you know what the prize is? The Kong Fu Bible I've been dying to get my hands on! I never expected the event host to have such a treasure. But here's the thing... making a 100-meter-long noodle all on my own might be quite tricky. That's where you come in, Commandant! You can take charge of the dough kneading, and I'll pull it into noodles. With our teamwork, victory is practically guaranteed!\\nSo, how about we make a little bet? If you help me win the contest, I'll let you borrow the grand prize. Deal?\\nWell then, I'll see you there, Commandant!",

I'm happy to settle for a copy. The original should stay with the rightful winner!\\nIn return, how about we celebrate my Activation Date together again next year? We can plan a more fun event with everyone!\\nUnfortunately, I only have one Activation Date every year, and it always feels like I can never find a good excuse at other times. Wait, I mean... it's not an excuse!\\nIt's just that... who knows how long it'll be until we meet again... Oh, right! Now that you've got that secret codex of martial arts, we can train together!\\nBuilding physical strength is crucial for a commandant like you, isn't it? So, let's work on our inner power! May our journey lead us to the pinnacle of martial arts!\\n*If, by any chance, you dare to slack off and not come find me, I'll go all the way to Babylonia to check up on you.",
